# Francis Maile - WebDev

I am a remote web developer currently based in the Pacific North West of USA. A creative professional
driven to use the best tools and technologies to produce the best possible
result for your project. My focus is on building a website that helps you reach your *business* goals.

A web site should enhance your business and help you reach  _your business_  goals. I build web sites to support your business needs.

-   You need a better web site.
-   I build better web sites.
-   A win-win

Need something about the technologies I use.


-   Your project deserves a clean attractive design
-   You deserve a painless process
-   You should get decent value for your investment
-   The project needs to come in on time and on budget
-   Tell me more...

Who am I really as a developer?

- Long time beginner
- purist:
  - HTML
  - CSS - no Sass - Compass, Bourbon, Susy, etc, LESS, ... maybe. I need to look into this.
  - VanillaJS - no frameworks - Angular, React, JQuery
