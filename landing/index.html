				<h2>B.O.O.K. features:</h2>
				<section id="feature-list" class="info">
					<ul>
						<li class="feature">
							<h3 class="feature-title"><i class="fas fa-recycle"></i>Recyclable</h3>
							BOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper
							, each capable of holding thousands of bits of information.
							The pages are locked together with a custom-fit device called a binder
							which keeps the sheets in their correct sequence.
						</li>
						<li class="feature">
							<h3 class="feature-title"><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i>Opaque Paper Technology (OPT)</h3>
							OPT allows manufacturers to use both sides of the sheet, doubling
							the information density and cutting costs. Experts are divided on
							the prospects for further increases in information density; for
							now, BOOKS with more information simply use more pages. Each
							sheet is scanned optically, registering information directly into
							your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next sheet.
						</li>
						<li class="feature">
							<h3 class="feature-title"><i class="fas fa-magic"></i>Crash-proof, Instant On Technology</h3>
							BOOK never crashes or requires rebooting, though, like other devices, it
							can become damaged if coffee is spilled on it and it becomes unusable if
							dropped too many times on a hard surface.  The "browse" feature allows
							you to move instantly to any sheet, and move forward or backward as
							you wish. Many come with an "index" feature, which pin-points the exact
							location of any  selected information for instant retrieval.
						</li>
						<li class="feature">
							<h3 class="feature-title"><i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>Available Accessories</h3>
							An optional <span class="hilight">"BOOKmark"</span> accessory allows you to open BOOK to the
							exact place you left it in a previous session - even if the BOOK has
							been closed.  BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus, a single
							BOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers.
							Conversely, numerous BOOK markers can be used in a single BOOK if
							the user wants to  store numerous views at once. The number is limited
							only by the number of pages in the BOOK. You can also make personal
							notes next to BOOK text  entries with optional programming tools,

					BOOK is a revolutionary breakthrough in technology: no wires, no
					electric circuits, no batteries, nothing to be connected or switched on.
					It's so easy to use, even a child can operate it. Compact and portable, it
					can be used anywhere - even sitting in an armchair by the fire - yet it is
					powerful enough to hold as much  information as a CD- ROM disc
				</div>
				<div>
					Portable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a precursor of
					a new entertainment wave. BOOK's appeal seems so certain that
					thousands of content creators have committed to the platform and
					investors are reportedly flocking to invest. Look for a flood of new titles
					soon.
